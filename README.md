Electricity generation by utility scale facilities

Project started April 2016

When running script_with_key.py:
*update_json_post() goes with the larger, more metadata file, dataset.json (5.5MB)
*update_json() goes with data.json ()

The first gets 2000 series, runs in 2.5mins, but the datafile is huge and transmitting it will be unfun.

The second gets 1000 series in a much sadder and longer time, so I need to fix this. :(
